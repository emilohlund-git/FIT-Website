# Milestone Project #1 - Personal Trainer website
[This project on github pages](https://emilohlund-git.github.io/FIT-Website/)

## UX

## Features
1. Fixed Navbar (With a hamburger icon for mobile) 
* I believe it suits the fact of having a fixed navbar to hide the menu buttons behind a hamburger icon.
2. Hero Image with a Call To Action button
* It's an easy and fast way to display what this website is going to be about, and to provide a fast shortcut to the most essential part of the website.
3. Interactive images with modals
* Again to keep it minimalistic and be able to provide the information in a way where it doesn't crowd the website.
4. Bootstrap cards with the [fancybox](https://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) plugin
* Following the minimalistic theme where I can showcase a lot of projects and not take up a whole lot of space. Also having it turn into a carousel in smaller width browser windows helps.
5. Contact form
* Great way to be able to get in touch as easy, and as fast as possible.
7. Footer with social media links
* Recognizable, fast way to showcase the platforms where you are active.
8. Animated the landing page and the CTA button
* Stiffens up the landing page.

## Technologies Used
1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* Using Bootstrap for it's flexibility with responsive websites, and great component library.
2. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* For it's functionality with Bootstrap elements and it's easy ability of targeting and animating elements in HTML using Javascript.
3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* The project includes Font Awesome for, well, icons.

## Testing
No real testing was done for this project, all elements are very straight forward.
