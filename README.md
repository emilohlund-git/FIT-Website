# Milestone Project #1 - Personal Trainer website
[This project on github pages](https://emilohlund-git.github.io/FIT-Website/)

## UX

## Features
1. Fixed Navbar (With a hamburger icon for mobile) 
* Implemented using CSS animations and jQuery's toggle method.
2. Bootstrap carousel
3. Contact form
* Great way to be able to get in touch as easy, and as fast as possible.
4. Footer with social media links
* Recognizable, fast way to showcase the platforms where you are active.

## Technologies Used
1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* Using Bootstrap for it's flexibility with responsive websites, and great component library.
2. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* For it's functionality with Bootstrap elements and it's easy ability of targeting and animating elements in HTML using Javascript.
3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* The project includes Font Awesome for, well, icons.
4. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* I think it's awesome to work more in an object oriented fashion with CSS.

## Testing
Testing for this project was basically just me clicking around and checking so that everything is responsive and working as intended.
